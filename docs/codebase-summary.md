# Codebase summary

High-level map of the cube-playground app, updated as features ship.

## Top-level layout

- `src/QueryBuilderV2/NewMetric/` — the New Metric wizard. Two entry points:
  - **Full-page wizard** at `/metrics/new?v=2` (`full-page/`). Six steps:
    Source → Operation → Column → Filters → Identity → Test run.
  - **Legacy modal dialog** (`NewMetricDialog.tsx` + `sections/`). Single-cube
    only. Kept alive during the full-page rollout via the parallel-sync
    compat shim in `useNewMetricDraft`. Slated for retirement after GA.

## New Metric draft model

The wizard's draft (`NewMetricDraftV2`) carries a canonical multi-source /
N-slot shape plus parallel legacy fields kept in lock-step by the reducer:

```
sourceCubes: string[]                   // primary cube is index 0
inputs: Record<string, string | null>   // slotId → qualified member name
                                        //   "value" for scalar ops
                                        //   "numerator" + "denominator" for ratio

// Legacy mirrors — synced automatically by useNewMetricDraft's reducer.
// Read by the legacy dialog flow; new code should prefer the canonical pair.
sourceCube:  string | null              // = sourceCubes[0] ?? null
ofMember:    string | null              // = inputs[primarySlotIdFor(op)]
ofMemberB:   string | null              // = inputs.denominator (ratio only)
```

`OperationDef` declares `inputs: InputSlot[]` + `minSources: number`. Ratio
is `minSources: 2` with two numeric slots; all other ops are `minSources: 1`
with one optional or required slot.

## Step gates and validation

- **Step 1 → 2**: `sourceCubes.length >= 1`. Picking multiple cubes is allowed.
  The first selected is the primary (where the YAML measure file lives); the
  rest expand the reachable-member pool for Step 3.
- **Step 2 → 3**: `operation` set. Cards whose `minSources > sourceCubes.length`
  render as locked; clicking one snaps the user back to Step 1 with a
  transient pulse on the source toolbar.
- **Step 3 → 4**: every required slot in `op.inputs` is filled.
  Cross-cube ratio is allowed — the YAML emitter uses each member's own
  `cubeName` to produce `{cubeA}.x / NULLIF({cubeB}.y, 0)`.

`useReachableMembers` accepts either a single cube name or an array.
Multi-source consumers pass the full `sourceCubes`; the hook unions reachable
members from every selected cube and de-dupes by qualified name.
