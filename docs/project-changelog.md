# Changelog

Significant changes to the cube-playground app, newest first.

## 2026-05-17

### Added — New Metric: multi-source selection + N-slot inputs (Ratio cross-cube)

- `NewMetricDraft` migrated from `(sourceCube, ofMember, ofMemberB)` to the
  canonical multi-source / N-slot shape `(sourceCubes[], inputs{})`. Legacy
  fields kept in lock-step by the reducer so the dialog flow keeps working.
- `OperationDef.inputs: InputSlot[]` + `OperationDef.minSources: number`
  replace the old single `OperationAccepts` field. Ratio declares two numeric
  slots (`numerator`, `denominator`) and `minSources: 2`.
- **Step 1** now supports multi-select with a "Primary" badge and a
  "Make primary" affordance on selected non-primary cards.
- **Step 2** gates each operation card on `minSources` vs the current source
  count. Clicking a locked card snaps back to Step 1 with a brief pulse on
  the source toolbar.
- **Step 3** renders one slot-picker grid per `op.inputs[]` entry. Cross-cube
  measures are eligible when their cube is in `sourceCubes` and joinable.
- **YAML emitter** now produces `{cubeA}.x / NULLIF({cubeB}.y, 0)` for
  cross-cube ratio; same-cube ratio output is byte-identical to before.
- Validator drops the cross-cube ratio ban; new error keyed by `inputs.<slotId>`
  when a required slot is empty.

## 2026-05-16 and earlier

See `git log` for full history. Highlights:
- Full-page New Metric wizard rebuild (`/metrics/new?v=2`), 6-step flow.
- CDP projection + Catalog UI iterations.
- New Metric polish: shell layout, compact operation pills, live auto-name.
